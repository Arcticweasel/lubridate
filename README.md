# Lubridate

This repository is about learning how to deal with dates and times in R more easily using the lubridate package. It will cover the following actions regarding dates and datetimes: 

* creating dates and datetimes
* getting and setting components
* rounding
* working with time spans
* working with time zones

For specific advice and easy functions when it comes to working with times only, consulting the "hms" package is recommended.

# Data

The data used to provide examples is an excerpt from the Stanford Open Policing Project.
This project gathers and analyzes data of traffic stops from nearly all states of the USA.
The excerpt used in this repository shows data of traffic stops in Rhode Island from 2005 until 2015.
More information on this project can be found at [The Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/).
